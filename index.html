                My name is Tatum Daily. I am happily married to my wife Amber. We have a five month old
                daughter named Emery. I currently work full time at the United States Post Office as a 
                regular rural carrier. I signed up for this boot camp because I want to become a better
                provider for my family while also doing something that I enjoy.
            </p>

            <p>
                My motivation to become the best me is undoubtedly my family. I love my wife more every
                single day I spend with her. I love growing with her as a family as well as individuals.
                Our daughter is the other love of my life, only other parents can truly understand how I
                love her. I know my success in this course is inevitable, because my motivation is rock
                solid. Being able to provide a stable, bright future for my family is dependant upon my
                success, and is my main goal in life.
